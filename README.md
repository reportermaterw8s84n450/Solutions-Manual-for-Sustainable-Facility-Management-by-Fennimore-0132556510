  * This all-encompassing text thoroughly illuminates the methods, “how-to” skills, equipment, and best practices of modern facility management. Emphasizing practical operational aspects of sustainable facility management, Sustainable Facility Management covers many topics that are absolutely essential to sustainability -- some of them covered in no other text. Embracing multiple subject areas, it can easily be used as the main text for a capstone course of a facility management degree program. Topics covered include: organizational structure; cultural issues associated with property/facility management; career opportunities; financial, construction, and emergency management; environmental issues; HVAC, energy, and water management; green building; strategic management, and more. Throughout, chapter questions, assignments, photos, and diagrams help students deepen their understanding. These are complemented by many first-hand insights about effective facility management.
